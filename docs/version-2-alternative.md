## SECTION 1 – Event → Impact → Action (+ diagram)

**Title**

From any supply-chain event to clear impact and action

**Paragraph**

Alora ingests ERP, email, and BOM signals and runs an AI engine that scores every P/N.
Whether it's a delay, EOL notice, tariff change, or quality issue, Alora shows which builds and customers are affected, how much is at risk, and who on your team owns the next move.

**Line above the diagram**

The diagram below is one example: a single event on a part, mapped through the BOM to builds, customers, and a ranked list of actions by role.

**Caption under the diagram**

Any part-level event → visible impact → ranked actions across your supply chain.

## SECTION 2 – Who Alora is built for

**Title**

Who Alora is built for

**Intro**

Alora is built for complex, BOM-driven hardware manufacturers where a single part can put a whole build at risk.

**Industries**

- **Medical devices** – regulated, multi-discipline assemblies where build readiness and traceability are critical.
- **Robotics & automation** – multi-level BOMs, long-lead motion and control components, tightly sequenced builds.
- **Industrial equipment & machinery** – engineer-to-order, configurable BOMs, high-value parts, frequent ECOs.
- **Electronics & systems** – many suppliers, global lead times, and design/component changes that ripple through the BOM.

## SECTION 4 – Features / Products

**Title**

What Alora does for you

**Intro**

All tools are powered by the same AI risk engine that turns supply-chain events into ranked P/N risk and next moves.
We start with three core modules and are continuously adding new workflows on top of the same engine.

### Feature 1 – PO Risk & Tracking

**Title**

PO Risk & Tracking

**One-liner**

Turn open POs into a ranked TODO list, not a static report.

**Bullets**

- See all PO lines ordered by risk and business impact
- Understand which builds and customers each line affects
- Get suggested next moves for risky lines (follow-up, escalate, re-confirm, split)

### Feature 2 – CTB & Build Readiness

**Title**

CTB & Build Readiness

**One-liner**

Know if you can really build — before the line is exposed.

**Bullets**

- Connect part availability and risk to upcoming builds and projects
- Highlight shortages and bottlenecks at the BOM level
- Show which orders and customers are at risk if nothing changes

### Feature 3 – Vendor Behavior & Scoring

**Title**

Vendor Behavior & Scoring

**One-liner**

See how suppliers actually behave, not just what's written on the PO.

**Bullets**

- Track real lead times vs. quoted, confirmation patterns, and slips
- Score suppliers at the part level based on behavior and risk
- Feed vendor scores into prioritization so risky suppliers surface first

## SECTION 5 – Security & Trust

**Title**

Security you can build on

**Text**

Alora works with sensitive BOM, PO, and supplier data, so security is built into the product.
We follow industry best practices for data protection, access control, and monitoring.
Your data stays your own and is never pooled or shared across customers.

## SECTION 6 – The team

**Title**

The team behind Alora

**Text**

Alora is built by people who have lived both the factory floor and the data stack:
supply-chain and operations leaders from complex hardware companies,
ERP and process experts who implemented systems like SAP and Priority,
and AI builders who know how to turn messy ERP, email, and BOM data into ranked, actionable decisions.

## SECTION 7 – Final CTA

**Title**

See Alora on your own data

**Text**

We usually start with a focused look at your open POs and upcoming builds — enough to show impact without heavy IT work.
