1. **Section — Hero (Above the Fold)**

<u>**Website content**</u>
**Headline**
- Where supply-chain risks become clear, ranked, and actionable
- Prevent supply-chain issues before they break execution
- Prevent execution breakdowns by making supply-chain risk clear and actionable
- Prevent supply-chain issues by turning every signal into action

**Subline (approved alternatives)**
- Alora continuously evaluates execution signals at the part and BOM level, connects them to business impact, and guides teams to the right actions before issues escalate.
- Every change creates risk. Alora captures it, measures its impact across BOMs, and drives the next best action – so teams always know what to handle first
- Alora detects and prioritizes execution risk across parts, BOMs, and customer commitments – so teams act early, not in firefighting mode.
- Evaluate supply chain triggers at the part and BOM level, understand their business impact, and prioritize the actions that protect delivery, revenue, and margins.

**Support line (****optional****)**
- Built for complex, BOM-driven manufacturers where small changes cascade fast

<u>**Section Design Spec**</u>
**Purpose**
Immediately signal relevance and credibility to execution owners by framing Alora around **prioritized execution**, not visibility, planning, or generic AI.
This section must answer, in one glance:
“Is this built for my kind of supply chain problem?”

**Core motivation (buyer reality)**
Execution leaders are overwhelmed by:
- Too many signals
- Too little prioritization
- Late discovery of issues
- Tools that show data but don’t reduce decisions

They are looking for **judgment and focus**, not more information.
If a VP Supply Chain reads only the headline and subheadline, they should think:
“They’re talking about the stuff that blows up *right before* I find out about it.”

**Core rules**
1. Headline must be **execution-first** (verb or outcome).
1. No AI, no platform language.
1. No “visibility”, “end-to-end”, or “control tower” framing.
1. BOM relevance must be clear in either headline or subline.
1. Business outcomes (delivery, revenue, margins) must be explicit.

**Language to use**
- Prioritized execution
- Part-level / BOM-grounded
- Business impact
- Actions that protect

**Language to avoid**
- Visibility
- Platform
- AI-powered
- Digital transformation
- Single source of truth

**How the prospect should feel**
“This sounds like it was written by someone who owns delivery.”
If they feel curiosity but not pressure, the hero worked.

**Reference & review check**
Ask:
“Would a VP Supply Chain forward just this screenshot internally?”
If not → rewrite.

1. **Section — Execution Loop (How execution ****actually works****)**

<u>**Website content**</u>
**How execution ****actually works**** (when it works)**
**1. Changes are captured early — wherever they appear**
Changes don’t need to be hunted.
Supplier updates, EOL notices, price shifts, shortages, logistics disruptions, internal changes, market events —
they’re continuously captured as they happen, across the execution surface.
Nothing waits for someone to notice it.
Nothing depends on someone knowing where to look.
**Execution starts early — by default.**
**2. Context and risk are built automatically, in minutes**
Every change is immediately analyzed at the **part level**, then grounded upward:
- Which BOMs are affected
- Which builds and customers are exposed
- What the execution risk actually is

Context isn’t stitched together manually.
Risk isn’t debated in meetings.
Impact is clear — **in minutes, not weeks**.
This is where execution stops being reactive.
**3. Decisions are evaluated, not guessed**
With context and risk understood, teams can finally work the problem — not just react to it.
Options are evaluated:
- Expedite or wait
- Use inventory or reallocate
- Split builds or adjust schedules
- Switch suppliers or absorb cost

Tradeoffs are visible.
Cost, timing, and impact are explicit.
Not everything is urgent —
but the right things become obvious.
**4. Execution moves — with leverage**
From there, execution doesn’t stall.
Teams get:
- Clearly prioritized actions
- Suggested resolution paths
- And the ability to act immediately

Whether that means:
- Triggering supplier outreach
- Routing work internally
- Updating systems
- Coordinating next steps

Actions can be executed automatically —
**always with a human in control.**
This is execution with leverage, not heroics.
**Closing line**
That’s the execution loop Alora runs continuously — so teams act early, confidently, and at scale.

<u>**Section Design Spec**</u>
**Purpose**
Create an “aha” moment – “Oh — this is what we’re missing.” – by showing the **ideal execution mode** — without first complaining about the current state.
This section reframes execution failure as **structural**, not personal.

**Core motivation**
Execution breaks because:
- Signals are missed
- Context arrives too late, missing, and not connected to business outcomes
- Risk is debated manually
- Action waits for alignment

Buyers want to see a **better operating loop**, not another tool.

**Core rules**
1. Describe the *ideal flow*, not today’s chaos.
1. No UI, no product architecture.
1. Each step must imply what’s missing today without saying it.
1. Risk must appear as part of context, not a standalone feature.
1. Automation must be subordinate to judgment.

**Language to use**
- Captured early
- Grounded to parts and BOM
- Risk in context
- Prioritized actions
- Human control

**Language to avoid**
- Dashboards
- Monitoring
- Alerts everywhere
- Autonomous execution
- Magic / intelligence metaphors

**How the prospect should feel**
“This is how we *should* be working — and we’re not.”
If they mentally map their own pain onto the flow, the section worked.

**Visual guidance**
- Scroll-based progression
- One concept per screen
- No screenshots
- Calm, inevitable motion

**Reference & review check**
Ask:
“Does this feel like an operating model, not a product pitch?”
If not → simplify.

1. **Section ****– ****Adoption Journey / Time to Value**** (onboarding)**

<u>**Website**</u><u>** content**</u>
**From first connection to running smoothly**
**Week 1 — Connect & calibrate (read-only)**
Securely connect supplier emails, docs, and ERP (read-only). Alora aligns parts, suppliers, and naming, and starts digesting execution signals so early triggers appear with BOM context.
**Week 2 — Context & prioritization emerge**
As signals accumulate, Alora builds part-level context across BOMs, builds, and business impact. Noise drops, priorities sharpen, and teams use it daily to understand what actually matters.
**Week 3 — Assisted execution (human-controlled)**
Write options unlock where approved. Alora prepares mitigated actions and next steps, and teams execute faster — email, ERP, or internal workflows — always with a human in control.
**Always on — Execution that keeps learning**
As execution changes, Alora adapts. Teams expand usage over time, add automation where it proves value, and avoid system maintenance while prioritization and risk assessment keep improving.

<u>**Purpose (Why this section exists)**</u>
To remove rollout anxiety by showing, **concretely and credibly**, how teams go from first connection to daily execution without a transformation project.
This section must answer:
- “How much effort does this take?”
- “When do I see value?”
- “When does it start writing / acting?”
- “Do I stay in control?”

Without triggering:
- Implementation fear
- IT escalation
- Vendor skepticism

**Core Motivation (Buyer Reality)**
Execution owners have been burned by:
- Long implementations
- Tools that demand upfront modeling
- Systems that require constant maintenance
- “AI” that acts before trust is earned

They want leverage **without disruption**.

**Core Rules (Non-negotiable)**
1. **Time must be explicit**
Use weeks. Avoid “instant”, “seamless”, or “plug-and-play”.
1. **Read-only before write**
Trust is earned before automation. This must always be clear.
1. **Effort is minimal, not zero**
We never claim “no effort”. We show *where* effort is required and *why it’s small*.
1. **ERP is optional, never required**
ERP is acknowledged early, but never positioned as a dependency.
1. **Automation is assisted, not autonomous**
Human control must be explicit in language.
1. **No onboarding jargon**
Never say:
    - implementation
    - migration
    - configuration
    - setup workflow

**Language to Use**
- “Connect”
- “Align”
- “Digest”
- “Build context”
- “Prepare actions”
- “Unlock”
- “Expand usage”
- “Human-controlled”

These sound like **execution**, not software projects.

**Language to Avoid**
- “Seamless”
- “Effortless”
- “Plug-and-play”
- “Autonomous”
- “End-to-end”
- “AI-powered”
- “Digital transformation”

These trigger skepticism in this ICP.

**How the Prospect Should Feel After Reading**
“This is not a project.”
“I can try this safely.”
“I know exactly when value appears.”
“I don’t lose control.”
“This fits how my team actually works.”
If they don’t feel this, the section has failed.

**Visual & Interaction Guidance (for later)**
- 4 equal-width boxes or left-to-right progression
- Calm motion (no flashing, no dashboards)
- Each box should feel **inevitable**, not aspirational
- No product UI screenshots here

**Reference Anchors (for future reviews)**
- Prysmic “Trust / Adoption” section → tone & specificity
- NOT Salesforce / Notion / generic SaaS onboarding
- Benchmark question:
    - “Would a VP Supply Chain forward this internally without rewriting it?”

1. **Section — Execution Impact (KPIs)**

<u>**Website content**</u>
**Execution impact**
**Decisions that stick**
Execution signals grounded to BOM and business impact replace alignment loops with confident decisions teams can act on immediately.

**Less manual work**
Automated tracking, follow-ups, and data alignment drive **~50% less manual execution work** and materially shorten execution cycle times.

**Execution unblocked**
Early detection of PO–OC–Invoice discrepancies prevents blocked approvals, last-minute expedites, and avoidable production stops.

**Revenue protected**
Early reaction to what actually matters helps preserve **~4% of revenue at risk** by avoiding late execution failures.

*(Optional / spare — not default)*
**Inventory avoided**
Real-time alignment between procurement, planning, and part-level risk prevents ordering materials that no longer matter before dead stock builds up.

<u>**Section Design Spec — Execution Impact**</u>
**Purpose**
Translate Alora’s execution value into **outcomes executives care about**, without overclaiming ROI or drifting into generic SaaS metrics.
This section exists to help a buyer answer:
“If this works, what actually changes in my operation?”

**Core motivation (buyer reality)**
Execution owners are measured on:
- Decisions that don’t get reversed
- Teams that aren’t overloaded
- Fewer stops and escalations
- Protecting delivery and revenue under constant change

They are skeptical of:
- ROI math
- Vanity percentages
- Benchmarks without mechanism

**Core rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**
1. **Execution outcomes > business KPIs**
We show how execution behavior changes. Business results follow.
1. **Numbers only where defensible**
Max 2 numeric claims in this section (50%, ~4%). No expansion.
1. **No guarantees, no promises**
Language must imply *enablement*, not certainty.
1. **Each KPI must be conceptually distinct**
No causal overlap between cards.
1. **No AI framing**
Outcomes, not technology.

**Language to use**
- Decisions that stick
- Execution unblocked
- Less manual work
- Revenue at risk
- Early reaction
- Grounded to BOM

**Language to avoid**
- ROI
- Savings guaranteed
- Productivity gains
- Autonomous
- Optimized margins
- End-to-end impact

**How the prospect should feel**
“These are exactly the things I’m held accountable for — and this feels believable.”
If they feel impressed but skeptical → **fail**
If they feel calm and nodding → **success**

**Visual & layout guidance**
- 4 equal-weight KPI cards
- No charts, no graphs, no progress bars
- No comparison tables
- Numbers should be visually understated (not hero typography)
- This section should feel **grounded, not celebratory**

**Review & maintenance checklist**
Before changing anything in this section, ask:
- Can sales explain this in one sentence?
- Is this still true for early deployments?
- Are we implying guarantees?
- Are two KPIs collapsing into the same idea?

If yes → **do not ship the change**

1. **Section — Who We Serve**

<u>**Website content**</u>
**Built for**
**Complex, BOM-driven hardware manufacturers**
*Where a single part can put a whole build at risk*

**Medical Devices**
Regulated, multi-level BOMs where late part changes cascade into production, compliance, and delivery risk.
**Robotics & Automation**
Tight tolerances, long lead times, and complex assemblies with zero slack for execution errors.
**Defense & Aerospace**
Low-volume, high-impact programs where every delay escalates across contracts, suppliers, and stakeholders.
**Industrial Equipment**
Highly configurable products, supplier variability, and long execution cycles that demand tight operational control.

<u>**Purpose of this section**</u>
Ground the narrative in **recognizable operating reality** and help the *right* buyer immediately self-identify — without forcing a decision.
This section is about **recognition**, not conversion.

**What this section must communicate**
- Alora is **not horizontal SaaS**
- It is purpose-built for **complex, BOM-centric execution**
- The problems described are **structural**, not maturity issues
- Alora understands industries where **small changes create large downstream risk**

**What this section must NOT communicate**
- Feature differentiation
- Generic “industries we serve” marketing language
- Overly broad applicability
- Claims of exclusivity (“only for”)

**How the reader should feel**
“This was written by people who understand how my world actually breaks.”
They should feel:
- Seen
- Understood
- Slightly relieved (“we’re not crazy, this *is* hard”)

**Design & copy guardrails**
- No bullets per industry beyond 1–2 sentences
- No acronyms unless unavoidable (FDA is OK, ITAR only if relevant)
- Keep tone operational, not promotional
- This section should **quiet the reader**, not excite them

1. **Section — Trust, Control & Security**

*(Intentionally ****not**** called “Security”** on the website**)*
<u>**Website content**</u>
**Built for sensitive operations**
Alora is designed for environments where data control, traceability, and execution authority matter.
- Read-only by default during onboarding
- Isolated customer environments and strict access boundaries
- No model training on customer data
- Human approval required for execution actions

*Security and architecture details available on request.*

<u>**Purpose of this section**</u>
Reduce friction with:
- Procurement
- IT
- Security-minded operators

…without turning the homepage into a compliance document.
This section exists to **remove fear**, not to prove compliance.

**What this section must communicate**
- Alora is **intentionally cautious**, not reckless AI
- Customers stay in control at all times
- Automation is gated, explainable, and reversible
- Security was designed in — not added later

**What this section must NOT communicate**
- Specific certifications you don’t yet have
- Deep technical architecture (VPCs, encryption, etc.)
- “Trust us” language
- Over-promising security guarantees

**How the reader should feel**
“This won’t get me in trouble.”
Specifically:
- Safe to share with IT
- Safe to pilot
- Safe to say yes to a demo

**Design & copy guardrails**
- Keep it compact (this is reassurance, not education)
- Avoid the word “AI” unless contextualized by control
- Prefer **defaults** (“read-only by default”) over claims
- Push deeper details to Q&A or sales follow-up

1. **FAQ — Final Version**

<u>**Website content (subject **</u><u>** **</u><u>**questions & answers)**</u>
<u>**Execution & intelligence**</u>
**What does Alora ****actually do**** day to day?**
Alora helps teams mitigate supply-chain issues as they emerge.
It organizes supplier communications, confirmations, changes, and discrepancies, ties them to parts and BOMs, and prioritizes what to act on based on business impact.
Teams then use it to execute the fastest resolution — replying to suppliers, expediting or splitting orders, escalating internally, or updating systems — without chasing context.

**How do you know which issues matter most?**
Prioritization is driven by risk evaluation.
Alora evaluates each issue based on:
• Probability (likelihood the issue will materialize)
• Impact (effect on builds, delivery, revenue, or cost)
That risk is calculated at the part and BOM level, so teams focus on the few issues that truly threaten execution — not the loudest signals.

**What kinds of discrepancies do you detect?**
Common examples include:
• Price and quantity changes
• Date and lead-time shifts
• PO–OC–Invoice mismatches
• Missing or conflicting confirmations
Thresholds can be tuned so teams only see what truly matters.

**Can you handle different supplier formats?**
Yes. Alora is built to extract and reconcile information across varied supplier formats and documents — without requiring per-supplier setup.
When confidence is low, it flags items for human review.

<u>**Decision transparency & reliability**</u>
**Can we see where decisions come from?**
Yes.
Every task, recommendation, or priority includes:
• The source signals (emails, documents, ERP)
• The BOM and part context
• The reasoning logic behind the prioritization
This allows teams to understand why something surfaced, not just what to do — which is critical in sensitive execution environments.

**How reliable are Alora’s recommendations?**
Alora operates at over 95% reliability in surfacing and prioritizing execution issues.
Each recommendation includes its source signals, context, and reasoning history, so teams can understand why it surfaced and validate it quickly.
When confidence is lower, Alora flags the issue and escalates it for human review rather than guessing.
This ensures speed where possible — and caution where required.

<u>**Autonomy & control**</u>
**Is Alora fully autonomous?**
No — and intentionally so.
Alora is autonomous where speed matters (detecting issues, assembling context, evaluating risk, preparing actions), and human-controlled where judgment matters.
Think of it as an execution control tower:
• The system works continuously in the background
• Humans decide how much autonomy to allow
• Critical actions are approved, adjusted, or overridden by your team
You control the level of autonomy, not the other way around.

**When does Alora ****take action**** on our behalf?**
Write actions (emails, ERP updates) are enabled only when your team is comfortable, typically around week 3, and always in coordination with IT.
Some teams enable earlier; others stay read-only longer. It’s your call.

**Can we control alert sensitivity?**
Yes. Teams can define thresholds and escalation rules to avoid noise and focus on meaningful execution risk.

<u>**Integration & workflow impact**</u>
**What do you connect to first?**
Supplier email inboxes + key docs (OCs, invoices, PDFs), and optionally ERP via API—read-only first. (This matches how you described “connected to emails + option to be synced to ERP.”)

**What systems can Alora connect to?**
Alora connects to the systems teams already use — without rip-and-replace.
This includes:
• Any ERP (via API, read-only initially)
• Procurement systems (e.g., Coupa)
• Supplier emails
• Excel files, PDFs, and documents
Most customers start with email, documents, and ERP in “read-only”.

**Do we need to change how our team works?**
No. Alora fits into how execution already happens today.
Teams keep working with the same tools and workflows – Alora just makes sense of the noise and surfaces what actually needs attention.

<u>**Time to value & rollout**</u>
**How quickly do we see value?**
Customers start seeing value within the first week after initial integration.
Signals begin appearing immediately, with context and prioritization improving as more data is ingested.

**Who needs to be involved from our side?**
Typically:
• 1–2 execution owners (procurement / supply chain)
• An IT or security contact to approve access
Most teams start with a small pilot group, then expand once value is clear.

**How does a pilot work?**
Pilots typically run 1–2 months, scoped to your environment.
They’re paid and measured against clear metrics such as decision cycle time, blocked execution reduction, and manual workload reduction.

**How do you define pilot success?**
Typical success metrics include:
• Faster execution decisions (weeks → same day)
• Reduced manual reconciliation and follow-ups
• Fewer missed discrepancies and late escalations
• Clearer prioritization of execution risk
We align on success criteria upfront.

**What happens after the pilot?**
Teams usually expand usage to additional workflows or sites once value is clear.
Alora continues adapting automatically as suppliers, volumes, and priorities change.
The Alora team remains available for support, questions, and guidance as needed — but the system does not require ongoing coordination or maintenance to stay effective in day-to-day execution.

<u>**Security & data access**</u>
**Are you reading all our emails?**
No.
Alora only reads relevant supplier communications, based on controlled rules you define.
Internal, personal, or unrelated emails are ignored.

**How is customer data isolated?**
Each customer operates in a logically isolated tenant context, with:
• Tenant-scoped databases and queues
• Isolated credentials and secrets
• Strict access controls and audit logging
There is no cross-customer data access.

**Do you train AI models on our data?**
No. Customer data is not used to train shared models.
AI is used strictly for structured extraction and execution analysis, with no persistent data retention in external model providers.

**How is Alora hosted?**
Alora is hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) in the US (us-east1) region.
The system is designed with tenant isolation, least-privilege access, and private networking as defaults.

**Are you SOC 2 compliant?**
We are currently undergoing SOC 2 certification with EY, expected to complete in the coming months.
Our security architecture already follows SOC-aligned best practices, and we can share details during security review.

**Purpose of the FAQ section**
The FAQ exists to **remove friction, not to educate**.
Its job is to:
- Answer the questions prospects are *already asking internally*
- Reduce perceived risk before a demo or pilot
- Allow champions to forward the page to IT, Ops, or leadership without anxiety

This is not a sales asset.
It is a **risk-reduction asset**.

**When this section is read (buyer mindset)**
The FAQ is typically read when:
- A VP/Director is validating whether this is “safe to pursue”
- An operator is pressure-testing whether Alora fits real execution
- An internal champion is preparing to loop in IT or Finance
- A buyer is deciding whether to book a serious call

They are skeptical, pragmatic, and short on patience.

**What this section must communicate**
1. **Alora is grounded in execution reality**
    - Not theoretical
    - Not aspirational
    - Built for messy, human, email-driven supply chains
1. **Humans stay in control**
    - Autonomy is adjustable
    - No hidden actions
    - No black-box decisions
1. **Integration is low-risk and reversible**
    - Read-only first
    - No forced migrations
    - No process rewrites
1. **Security was designed intentionally**
    - Clear data boundaries
    - Tenant isolation
    - Conservative defaults
1. **The system works without babysitting**
    - No consulting dependency
    - No heavy configuration burden
    - Support is available, not required

**What this section must NOT communicate**
- Feature marketing
- “AI platform” language
- Promises of guaranteed ROI
- Over-technical security architecture
- Anything that sounds like ongoing services or heavy change management

If a sentence feels like it belongs in a pitch deck → it does not belong here.

**Tone & language rules**
**Tone**
- Calm
- Direct
- Confident, not excited
- Operator-to-operator

**Language to use**
- “Read-only by default”
- “Human-controlled”
- “Grounded in part and BOM context”
- “You control”
- “When confidence is lower, it escalates”

**Language to avoid**
- Autonomous (without qualification)
- End-to-end
- Intelligent automation
- Seamless
- Best-in-class
- Transformational

**Structural rules**
- Questions should sound like they came from **real discovery calls**
- Answers should be:
    - Short
    - Concrete
    - One idea at a time
- No cross-references to other sections (“as described above”)
- No repeated claims from the homepage hero

**Visual / UX guidance (important)**
- FAQ should be **collapsible**, not a wall of text
- Grouped by theme (Execution, Control, Integration, Security, Rollout)
- Avoid icons or illustrations — this is about trust, not inspiration
- This section should *slow the reader down*, not excite them

**Maintenance & governance rules**
Before adding or changing a FAQ item, ask:
1. Did a **real prospect ask this**?
1. Does this reduce risk or increase it?
1. Are we explaining *how it works* instead of *why it’s great*?
1. Could this trigger unnecessary IT/legal scrutiny?

If the answer to #4 is “yes” → rewrite or remove.

**Success criteria (how you know it’s working)**
- Prospects forward the FAQ internally without rewriting it
- IT/security conversations start smoother
- Fewer “but how does it really work?” questions on sales calls
- Champions feel safer pushing the process forward

**Final note (important)**
The FAQ is the **last line of defense** against:
- Misinterpretation
- Over-selling
- Buyer anxiety

If everything above the FAQ excites the buyer,
the FAQ should **calm them down**.

1. **CTA**** – Call to Action**

<u>**Primary CTA**</u>
**Button text**
**Talk to us**
(This is intentionally simple, understated, and senior-friendly.)
<u>**CTA subline**</u>
A focused conversation about execution — we’ll walk through how it actually works

**CTA goal (very explicit)**
The CTA exists to **open a serious, low-risk conversation** — not to convert, not to demo, not to push commitment.
It should:
- Feel safe for senior operators
- Be easy to forward internally
- Signal respect for the buyer’s time
- Match Alora’s execution-first, no-BS posture

If the CTA feels “salesy,” it breaks trust.
If it feels stiff, it kills momentum.

**Where the CTA should appear (MANDATORY)**
**1. Hero section (above the fold)**
- One primary CTA only
- No secondary buttons
- No form
- CTA must feel like a *natural next step*, not a demand

**Layout guidance:**
- Button directly under headline + subline
- CTA is visually calm, not oversized

**2. After the “inevitable process” / execution flow section**
This is where the reader thinks:
“If this is real, I want to see it applied to us.”
Same CTA. Same wording. No variation.

**3. Bottom of page (final CTA)**
This is the only place where you can slightly reframe the CTA **without changing the button text**.
**Button:**
**Talk to us**
**Supporting line (optional, one sentence max):**
*We’ll start with one real execution flow and see if Alora is a fit.*
This reinforces:
- No commitment
- No pitch
- Fit-first mindset

**What happens after the CTA (critical)**
Clicking the CTA should lead to:
- A short scheduling flow or contact form
- Framed as:
    - “Exploration call”
    - or “Initial execution conversation”
- Clear expectations:
    - 30–45 minutes
    - One real workflow
    - No demo deck
    - No commitment

**Do NOT:**
- Call it “Book a demo”
- Auto-route to a sales-heavy page
- Ask for excessive form fields

**Language & behavior to avoid in CTA context**
❌ Demo
❌ Book
❌ Get started
❌ Try now
❌ See AI in action
❌ Transform your supply chain
All of these contradict your positioning.

**How the CTA should make the buyer feel**
“This feels like a serious conversation worth having.”
Not:
- “I’m being sold”
- “I’m committing to something”
- “This is marketing fluff”

**CTA success criteria**
You’ll know the CTA is right when:
- Prospects come into calls prepared
- Internal champions forward the site confidently
- Conversations start with execution reality, not product explanation
- Fewer calls stall due to misaligned expectations
