## 1. Hero

**Headline**

Better supply-chain decisions, from BOM to bottom line.

Where supply-chain risk turns into actions

Give Your Supply Chain the Power to See Risks Early and Act the Same Day

Where every supply-chain event becomes clear, ranked, and actionable.

**Subheading**

For complex hardware manufacturers, Alora uses AI to connect BOM, parts, and suppliers to builds and customers — starting with a risk-based worklist for procurement and planning, and evolving into a decision layer for the entire supply chain.

See your BOM insights across your workflows - analyzing risks per each item..

Ingest BOMs, POs, and supplier updates, keep them continuously in sync, and map every part to its builds and customers.
Upgrade to a platform that turns part-level risk into decisions across your entire supply chain.

Ingest BOMs, POs, and supplier updates, keep them continuously in sync, and map every part to its builds and customers.
Upgrade to a platform that turns part-level risk into confident supply-chain decisions.

Pull BOM, ERP, and email signals into one live model of your parts, suppliers, and builds.
Upgrade to a platform that gives every team the same, trusted view of supply-chain risk and impact.

Alora captures supplier updates and system signals, calculates risk, and delivers a prioritized action plan that keeps your supply chain moving.

Every change triggers impact. Alora captures it, measures it, ranks it, and drives the next move. Your supply chain becomes actionable.

Catch SC risks across platforms, analyze real-time effects on your workflows and BOMs, mitigate to keep production on track and revenue secured. Upgrade to the way supply chain was meant to be managed.

Ingest all your data, store it indefinitely on your cloud, and query across all types with a unified syntax. Upgrade to a platform that extends observability beyond engineering.

Catch supply-chain risks, see their impact on BOMs and builds, and act before they hit production and revenue. Upgrade to predictive supply chain management.

## 2. What Alora does today

**Section title**

What Alora does today

**Text**

We start where part-level decisions matter most: procurement and planning.

Alora:

- Connects BOM, parts, suppliers, PO lines, builds, and customers
- Highlights which parts put upcoming builds and deliveries at risk
- Shows which customers and how much revenue are exposed when parts move
- Gives buyers and planners one shared, risk-based worklist of lines and builds to act on

In one sentence:

Alora gives buyers and planners one AI-driven, risk-based worklist of BOM parts and PO lines to act on, with the builds, customers, and revenue they affect.

For leadership, Alora rolls this into a simple view of:

- Which builds and customers are at risk
- How much is on the line
- Who owns the follow-up

## 3. Pain / Problem

**Section title**

The daily gap between data and decisions

Even with ERP, reports, and spreadsheets, procurement and planning teams still struggle to answer basic questions at the start of the day:

- Which lines should we focus on first?
- Can we really build this order on time?
- Which customers are at risk if certain parts slip?

Data is spread across ERP, Excel, and email, and deep, multi-level BOMs make it hard to see which specific part really blocks a build.

The result:

- Hours spent reconciling updates instead of acting
- Supply-chain leadership discovering risk when a build is already at risk of delay
- Finance feeling the impact only when it reaches revenue and margin

Alora closes this gap: turning part-level complexity into clear, business-aware decisions.

## 4. Who we're built for

**Section title**

Who we're built for

Alora is designed for complex hardware manufacturers where a single part can stop a build and BOMs are too deep to manage in spreadsheets.

**Industries**

- Medical devices
- Robotics
- Defense
- Industrial equipment and other multi-discipline hardware

**Company profile**

- Multi-level BOMs and sub-assemblies
- Many suppliers and long lead times
- ERP in place (e.g., SAP, Priority)
- Real-life risk still tracked in Excel and email

## 5. KPI / Impact

**Section title**

Impact Alora is built to deliver

This can be framed as "What teams aim to achieve with Alora" or "Target outcomes with Alora."

- **10× Faster – Decision making**

  From weekly spreadsheet reviews to same-day, risk-based worklists.

- **5% Reduction – Revenue risk**

  Identify and mitigate part-level risk before it delays builds and shipments.

- **50% Less – Manual work**

  Automated follow-ups, confirmations, and discrepancy tracking instead of inbox chasing.

- **80% Fewer – Blocked or surprise POs**

  Early alerts on confirmation gaps, date slips, and mismatched lines across BOM and PO.

## 6. Vision

**Section title**

Our vision: from BOM and part-level risk to business outcome

In complex hardware, everything starts with a BOM and a part number — and the risk attached to it.

Alora is building a decision layer on top of the BOM that connects each part, supplier, and BOM position to:

- Part-level risk
- Build readiness
- Revenue and margin impact

Over time, this BOM-driven, risk-aware view will support wider decisions in:

- **Sourcing** – which suppliers and parts to depend on, and where to add options
- **Operations** – which builds to protect or re-sequence when constraints hit
- **Finance** – how BOM-level risk and changes flow through to income and margin

Our direction is simple: connect BOM and part-level reality to business income, so every decision — from a buyer's next action to a board-level discussion — is grounded in the same, trusted picture.

## 7. The team

**Section title**

The team behind Alora

Alora was founded by people who have lived both the operational and technical sides of the problem.

- Supply-chain operators who ran procurement and planning for complex hardware — from EVs and telematics to medical robotics — where a single missing part could hold up multimillion-dollar projects.
- ERP and process owners who implemented and worked inside systems like SAP and Priority, while still relying on Excel and shared inboxes to understand what was really happening.
- AI and data experts who know how to connect unstructured signals (emails, PDFs, confirmations) with structured data (ERP, BOM, PO lines) and turn it into decisions, not just dashboards.

We're building the tool we wished we had: an AI-driven decision layer that finally connects BOM and part-level reality to business outcome — without forcing teams to rip and replace the systems they already use.

## 8. Final CTA

**Section title**

See Alora on your own data

We usually start with a focused pilot around active POs and upcoming builds — enough to prove value for procurement and planning without heavy IT work.

If you're dealing with complex BOMs, constant expediting, and recurring surprises, let's explore whether Alora is a fit.

## Notes & Ideas

**Yuval's thoughts**

Your SC risks are hiding in plain sight - they are killing your revenues, margins....

Hidden risks create massive revenue leakage (pain)
