Every procurement professional knows the feeling: it's Monday morning, and you're staring at a spreadsheet with 2,000 open PO lines. Somewhere in there are the five that will derail your production schedule this week. Good luck finding them.

## The spreadsheet trap

Spreadsheets are comfortable. They're familiar. And for small-scale operations, they work well enough. But as your supply chain grows, they become a liability:

- **No real-time updates** — By the time you update the sheet, the data is already stale
- **No prioritization** — Every line looks equally important (or unimportant)
- **No context** — You can't see which builds or customers are affected
- **No collaboration** — Version control becomes a nightmare

## The hidden cost of manual tracking

We've seen procurement teams spend 60-70% of their time on data gathering and reconciliation. That's time not spent on strategic supplier relationships, negotiations, or risk mitigation.

Consider what happens when a supplier sends an email saying "delivery delayed by 2 weeks":

1. Someone reads the email
2. They update the spreadsheet (maybe)
3. They might notify the planner
4. The planner checks which builds are affected
5. Someone escalates to management

*The manual process for handling a single supplier delay can take hours—or days*

This process can take hours—or days. Meanwhile, the production line keeps moving toward a cliff.

## What modern supply chains need

The answer isn't a better spreadsheet. It's a system that:

- **Ingests data automatically** from ERP, email, and supplier communications
- **Scores risk** based on business impact, not just delivery dates
- **Prioritizes actions** so you know exactly what to handle first
- **Connects the dots** between parts, builds, and customers

> "The goal isn't to track more data. It's to make better decisions faster."

## Making the transition

Moving away from spreadsheets doesn't mean throwing everything away overnight. The most successful transitions we've seen follow this pattern:

1. **Start with visibility** — Get all your PO data in one place
2. **Add intelligence** — Layer in risk scoring and prioritization
3. **Automate updates** — Connect to your data sources
4. **Expand scope** — Move from PO tracking to build readiness to vendor scoring

The key is proving value quickly. A focused pilot around active POs can show results in weeks, not months.

## The bottom line

Spreadsheets served us well for decades. But modern supply chains—with their complex BOMs, global suppliers, and razor-thin margins—need better tools.

The question isn't whether to modernize your procurement operations. It's how fast you can do it before your competitors do.
