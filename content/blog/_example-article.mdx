This example article demonstrates all the formatting features available for blog posts. Use it as a reference when writing your own articles.

**How to use this file:** Open it in a text editor (VS Code, etc.) or view on GitHub. Copy/paste the formatting examples you need into your own articles.

---

## Basic Text Formatting

Regular paragraph text looks like this. Keep paragraphs focused on one idea for better readability.

**Bold text** is great for emphasis. *Italic text* works for subtle emphasis or introducing terms. You can also combine ***bold and italic*** when needed.

## Headings

Use headings to organize your content. The article title is automatically an H1, so start with H2 for main sections.

### This is an H3 Subheading

Use H3 for subsections within a main section.

#### This is an H4

Use H4 sparingly, only for deep nesting when absolutely necessary.

---

## Lists

### Bullet Lists

Use bullet lists for items without a specific order:

- First item in the list
- Second item with more detail
- Third item
  - Nested item (indent with 2 spaces)
  - Another nested item
- Back to top level

### Numbered Lists

Use numbered lists for sequential steps or ranked items:

1. First step in the process
2. Second step follows
3. Third step completes the sequence
   1. Sub-step A
   2. Sub-step B
4. Final step

---

## Blockquotes

Use blockquotes for customer testimonials, important callouts, or citations:

> "Alora reduced our email processing time by 80% in the first month. The team finally has visibility into what's actually happening with our orders."
>
> — Operations Manager, Medical Device Company

You can also use blockquotes for important notes:

> **Important:** Always verify supplier confirmations against the original PO before marking as confirmed.

---

## Tables

Tables are great for comparing options or presenting structured data:

| Feature | Traditional Approach | With Alora |
|---------|---------------------|------------|
| Email Processing | Manual, 4+ hours/day | Automated, minutes |
| Risk Visibility | Reactive, after problems | Proactive, predictive |
| Data Accuracy | ~60% (human error) | ~95% (AI-verified) |
| Coverage | Sample-based review | All orders, all lines |

Another example with different alignment:

| Metric | Value | Improvement |
|:-------|:-----:|------------:|
| Processing Time | 15 min | 90% faster |
| Error Rate | 2% | 85% reduction |
| Coverage | 100% | Up from 30% |

---

## Code Blocks

For technical content, you can include code examples:

Inline code looks like `this variable` or `config.yaml`.

Multi-line code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```json
{
  "supplier": "Acme Corp",
  "po_number": "PO-4521",
  "status": "confirmed",
  "delivery_date": "2024-12-20"
}
```

```python
# Example Python code
def calculate_risk_score(po_line):
    factors = get_risk_factors(po_line)
    return sum(factors) / len(factors)
```

---

## Images

### Basic Image

Add images with descriptive alt text for accessibility:

![Supply chain dashboard showing PO tracking](/images/blog/thumb-supply-chain.svg)

### Image with Caption

Add a caption using italics on the next line:

![AI-powered analytics dashboard](/images/blog/thumb-analytics.svg)
*The Alora dashboard provides real-time visibility into supply chain operations.*

### Image Guidelines

- Upload images to `public/images/blog/`
- Use descriptive filenames: `po-tracking-dashboard.png`
- Recommended width: 1200px (auto-resized)
- Keep under 500KB (compress at tinypng.com)
- PNG for screenshots, JPG for photos

---

## Horizontal Rules

Use three dashes to create a horizontal divider between sections:

---

## Combining Elements

You can combine multiple elements for rich content:

### The Challenge: Manual Email Processing

Most procurement teams spend **4+ hours daily** just reading supplier emails. The problems compound:

1. **Volume overwhelm** — Hundreds of emails per day
2. **Hidden information** — Key data buried in attachments
3. **No prioritization** — Everything feels urgent

> "We were drowning in emails. Important delays got lost in the noise."

| Before Alora | After Alora |
|--------------|-------------|
| Manual triage | Auto-classified |
| 4 hours/day | 30 minutes/day |
| Reactive | Proactive |

The solution? Automated email intelligence that extracts, classifies, and prioritizes.
